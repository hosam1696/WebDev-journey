**The 4 Basic Parts of a computer**

* input 
    what is you put into the computer keyboard mouse


* output

* cpu
    stands for central processing unit

* memory
    where we store data and information 
    Hard Disk or Ram

>kilobyte > megabyte > gigabyte > tyrabyte > petabyte


Ram is *Volatile* memory

that means that stored information is lost when there is no power

MotherBoards and expansion cards and power supply

**MotherBorads** is what connects everything together
when the data flying around trying to find out where to go helps to route 

**expansion cards**
are cards like sound cards display cards ethernet cards

**Power supply**
provide the case with the power

* chips and Moor's Law

chip is consists of a fall of transistors which works as switches it could be one or zero so all this all transistor fit on a chip and that's how it controls information and store it
what make it faster is the the amount of transistors


**Moor's Law** 
Moore's Law is the observation that the amount of transistors fit on each chip has doubled every two years since 1965.


* Intro to Binary Numbers

* Measuring of Data Speed

measured by **bits** per seconds

**Audio**: kilobits/second
**Internet**: MegaBits/second 
**Network**: gigabits/second

> Data size mesured in bytes
> Data Speed mesured in bits

### Types of Computers

* super
    use a gole puch of cpus  parrallel processing
    that means that all these cpus work on these process or this problem in the same time



* Server

    hold and access data
    websites are hosted in server

* workstation 

    might look similar to pc computers but got more power in specficarion on it and much more expensive

* pc

    by far 

* microcontroller

    very specialized computer to do some tasks



* More on motherboards

    motherboards have 

    * expansions slots
        everything can increase the performance of the computer without putting load on cpu 
        graphics card 
        sound card 
        ethernet card


    * ports

    usb
    firewire sd cards
    audio


* Data Networks

    * **LAN** local Area Network

    * **WAN** Wide Arae Network uses cables

    * **VPN** Virtual Private Network uses internet


* IP Address

IP is determined based on location 

xxx.xxx.xx.xxx

How the Internet Works

Device > Modem > Router > Domain Name server < Web server >

### SOFTWARE

* OPERATING SYSYTEMS

* APPLICATIONS

Content Delivery Network *CDN*

faster & smoother and user experience

cdn pays ISP to get good routes

source codes

is the code that the programmer writes

it's just a text documnet

a computer has a way to interpritting them 

interpreter  |  compiler


* What do Programmers do ?

Coders, Developers, Software Engineer

all these people do is taking ideas and turing them into functional code
not just coding but alsoo maintaing it

Programmers take ideas and break them down into little tiny steps the computer can understand
