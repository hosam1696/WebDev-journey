Most JavaScript users get to a point at which they're actively using objects, functions, and even anonymous functions throughout their code. Rarely, however, are those skills taken beyond the most fundamental level. Additionally there is generally a very poor understanding of the purpose and implementation of closures in JavaScript, which helps to irrevocably bind the importance of functions to the language.

Understanding this strong relationship between objects, functions, and closures will improve your JavaScript programming ability giving you a strong foundation for any type of application development.

 timers and regular expressions. These two features have applications in virtually any JavaScript code base but aren't always used to their full potential due to their misunderstood nature

 Closures are one of the defining features of JavaScript. Without them, JavaScript would likely be another hum-drum scripting experience, but since that's not the case, the landscape of the language is forever shaped by their inclusion.

 A fun side effect of having so much control over how functions work, in JavaScript, is that you can completely manipulate their internal behavior, unbeknownst to the user. Specifically there are two techniques: The modification of how existing functions work (no closures needed) and the production of new self-modifying functions based upon existing static functions

 **Memoization** is the process of building a function which is capable of remembering its previously computed answers. As we demonstrated in the chapter on functions, it's pretty straight-forwards implementing these into an existing function. However, we don't always have access to the functions that we need to optimize.
