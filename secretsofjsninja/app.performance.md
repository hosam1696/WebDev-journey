##	Application	Performance

introducing	some	core	performance	concepts,	such	as	latency	or bandwidth,	and	continues	by	showcasing	how	to	measure	and	monitor	performance	as	part	of the	automated	build	process

A	good	application	is	one	that	has	a	set	of	desirable	*characteristics*,	which	includes *functionality*,	*reliability*,	*usability*,	*reusability*,	*efficiency*,	*maintainability*,	and	*portability*.	Over the	course	of	this	book	so	far,	we	have	understood	a	lot	about	maintainability	and	reusability. In	this	chapter,	we	will	focus	on	performance,	which	is	closely	related	to	reliability	and maintainability.
